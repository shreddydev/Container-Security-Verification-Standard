# V9:	Logging & Monitoring

## Control Objective

Securing containers and infrastructure is one thing but making sure that you know when things go wrong is no less important. Logging and monitoring provide you insights in the current state of your solution and allow you to react accordingly.

Ensure that a verified container solution satisfies the following high level requirements:

* Have a central logging and monitoring instance.
* Monitor all your components.

## Security Verification Requirements
