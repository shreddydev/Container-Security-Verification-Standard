# V12: Testing

## Control Objective

Technology is always moving forward and steadily changing in unexpected ways. Based on this securing a container-based solution isn't just a one-time effort, but different checks and validations should be done on a regular basis.

Ensure that a verified container solution satisfies the following high level requirements on a regular basis:

* Recovery from failure.
* Ensure that security settings are taking effect.
* Documentation of the current state of the container-based solution.

## Security Verification Requirements

The following requirements are to be evaluated based on a regular execution cycle. It is recommended to keep the cycle at three months or shorter.
